# Go Installer
This is small `bash` script to make the installation process of Go much simpler
and seemless in Linux and macOS.

## Usage
It's as simple as running the following command
```
curl -sL https://raw.github.com/k3rn31p4nic/go-installer/master/goinstaller.sh -o goinstaller.sh && chmod +x goinstaller.sh && ./goinstaller.sh <version>
```

For example, if you want to install version `1.13.5`, you'd run the following command
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.github.com/k3rn31p4nic/go-installer/master/goinstaller.sh -o goinstaller.sh && chmod +x goinstaller.sh && ./goinstaller.sh 1.13.5
```
